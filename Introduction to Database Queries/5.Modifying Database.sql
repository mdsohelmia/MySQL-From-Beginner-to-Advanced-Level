How to insert, delete and update database

The syntax of the CREATE TABLE AS statement:

CREATE TABLE table_name AS 
select_statement

Create a complete copy of the Invoices table:

CREATE TABLE invoices_copy AS
SELECT *
FROM invoices

Create a partial copy of the Invoices table:

CREATE TABLE old_invoices AS
SELECT *
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total = 0
 
Create a table with summary rows from the Invoices table:

CREATE TABLE vendor_balances AS
SELECT vendor_id, SUM(invoice_total) AS sum_of_invoices
FROM invoices
WHERE (invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total) <> 0
GROUP BY vendor_id

Delete a table:

DROP TABLE old_invoices

The syntax of the INSERT statement:

INSERT [INTO] table_name [(column_list)]
VALUES (expression_1[, expression_2]...)[,
	   (expression_1[, expression_2]...)]...

The column definitions for the Invoices table:

invoice_id			INT            NOT NULL		AUTO_INCREMENT,
vendor_id			INT            NOT NULL,
invoice_number		VARCHAR(50)    NOT NULL,
invoice_date		DATE           NOT NULL,
invoice_total		DECIMAL(9,2)   NOT NULL,
payment_total		DECIMAL(9,2)   NOT NULL		DEFAULT 0,
credit_total		DECIMAL(9,2)   NOT NULL		DEFAULT 0,
terms_id			INT            NOT NULL,
invoice_due_date	DATE           NOT NULL,
payment_date		DATE

Insert a single row without using a column list:

INSERT INTO invoices VALUES
(115, 97, '456789', '2018-08-01', 8344.50, 0, 0, 1, '2018-08-31', NULL)

Insert a single row using a column list:

INSERT INTO invoices:
       (vendor_id, invoice_number, invoice_total, terms_id, invoice_date, invoice_due_date)
   VALUES
       (97, '456789', 8344.50, 1, '2018-08-01', '2018-08-31')

Insert multiple rows:

INSERT INTO invoices VALUES
       (116, 97, '456701', '2018-08-02', 270.50, 0, 0, 1, '2018-09-01', NULL),
       (117, 97, '456791', '2018-08-03', 4390.00, 0, 0, 1, '2018-09-02', NULL),
       (118, 97, '456792', '2018-08-03', 565.60, 0, 0, 1, '2018-09-02', NULL)

The column definitions for the Color_Sample table:

color_id       INT           NOT NULL     AUTO_INCREMENT,
color_number   INT           NOT NULL     DEFAULT 0,
color_name     VARCHAR(50)

INSERT statements for the Color_Sample table:

INSERT INTO color_sample (color_number)
VALUES (606)

INSERT INTO color_sample (color_name)
VALUES ('Yellow')

INSERT INTO color_sample
VALUES (DEFAULT, DEFAULT, 'Orange')

INSERT INTO color_sample
VALUES (DEFAULT, 808, NULL)

INSERT INTO color_sample
VALUES (DEFAULT, DEFAULT, NULL)
 
 
 
The syntax for using a subquery to insert one or more rows:

INSERT [INTO] table_name [(column_list)]
select_statement

Insert paid invoices into the Invoice_Archive table:

INSERT INTO invoice_archive
SELECT *
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_total – payment_total - credit_total = 0
 
The same statement with a column list:

INSERT INTO invoice_archive
       (invoice_id, vendor_id, invoice_number,
       invoice_total, credit_total, payment_total,
       terms_id, invoice_date, invoice_due_date)
SELECT
       invoice_id, vendor_id, invoice_number,
       invoice_total, credit_total, payment_total,
       terms_id, invoice_date, invoice_due_date
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total = 0
  
The syntax of the UPDATE statement:

UPDATE table_name
SET  column_name_1 = expression_1
  [, column_name_2 = expression_2]...
 [WHERE search_condition]
 
Update two columns for a single row:

UPDATE invoices
SET payment_date = '2018-09-21', payment_total = 19351.18
WHERE invoice_number = '97/522'

Update one column for multiple rows:

UPDATE invoices
SET terms_id = 1
WHERE vendor_id = 95

Update one column for one row:

UPDATE invoices
SET credit_total = credit_total + 100
WHERE invoice_number = '97/522'


Update all invoices for a vendor:

UPDATE invoices
SET terms_id = 1
   WHERE vendor_id =
      (SELECT vendor_id
       FROM vendors
       WHERE vendor_name = 'Pacific Bell’)

Update the terms for all invoices for vendors in three states:

UPDATE invoices
SET terms_id = 1
WHERE vendor_id IN
      (SELECT vendor_id
       FROM vendors
       WHERE vendor_state
        IN ('CA', 'AZ', 'NV’))

The syntax of the DELETE statement:
 
DELETE FROM table_name
[WHERE search_condition]


Delete one row:

DELETE FROM general_ledger_accounts
WHERE account_number = 306

Delete one row using a compound condition:

DELETE FROM invoice_line_items
WHERE invoice_id = 78 AND invoice_sequence = 2

Delete multiple rows:
 
DELETE FROM invoice_line_items
WHERE invoice_id = 12
 
Use a subquery in a DELETE statement:

DELETE FROM invoice_line_items
WHERE invoice_id IN
       (SELECT invoice_id
        FROM invoices
        WHERE vendor_id = 115)
